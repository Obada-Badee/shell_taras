# Simple Shell

Simple Shell is a project for the ALX Software Engineering program, aiming to create a basic replica of the Unix shell. It provides a command-line interface where users can interact with the operating system by executing commands.

This Simple Shell implementation supports the execution of both built-in commands and external commands available in the system's `PATH`. It provides features such as command execution, handling command-line arguments, environment variable expansion, and more.

## Features

- Executes built-in commands such as `cd`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `alias`, and `exit`.
- Executes external commands available in the system's `PATH`.
- Supports command-line arguments, allowing users to pass arguments to commands.
- Handles environment variable expansion, allowing users to reference and expand variables in command arguments.
- Provides a basic prompt for input and command execution.
- Handles signals such as `Ctrl+C` to interrupt command execution.
- Provides error handling and informative error messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Simple Shell project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-shell.git`.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`.
3. Run the shell: `./shell`.

## Usage

The Simple Shell provides a command-line interface where you can enter commands. Here are some examples:

- Execute a command:
  
  $ ls -l
  

- Execute a built-in command:
  
  $ cd directory/
  

- Use command-line arguments:
  
  $ echo Hello, World!
  

- Use environment variable expansion:
  
  $ echo $HOME
